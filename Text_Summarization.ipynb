Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall. Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory. For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.\\nRonaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016\\u201317 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final. On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \\\"they made me who I am\\\". On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021. On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 away win against Atl\\u00e9tico, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2\\u20130 win over Club Am\\u00e9rica in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. He then scored a hat-trick in the 4\\u20132 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final. Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\\u20132 after extra-time. On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\\u00e9tico 3\\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u20132018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017\\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg. On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\\u00eamio in the final. On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi. On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\\u20133 win against Girona.\\n\\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \\\"PlayStation goal\\\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\\u20133 on aggregate. It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club. In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\\n\\n\\n=== Juventus ===\\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \\u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \\u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\\u00e9rez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018\\u20132020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \\\"violent conduct\\\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances. Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107's winner in a 1\\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\\u20130 away win over Fiorentina. After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate. Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.\\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 home win against Atl\\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April. In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan. Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored his first goal of the 2019\\u201320 season in a 4\\u20133 home league win over Napoli on 31 August 2019. On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3\\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive season, equalling Ra\\u00fal and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time, and equalled Ra\\u00fal's record of scoring against 33 different opponents. On 6 November in a 2\\u20131 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4\\u20130 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis S\\u00e1nchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3\\u20130 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games, and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2\\u20131 away defeat to Hellas Verona. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2\\u20131 away win against SPAL.\\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin D\\u017eeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.

Despite the win, the tie finished 2\\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.\\n\\n\\n==== 2020\\u20132021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure ====\\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria. On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\\u20131 away win. On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.

On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3\\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.\\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \\u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR. Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \\\"no intention\\\" of remaining a Juventus player. On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\\n\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Atalanta, and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November. On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.\\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals. On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 win over Norwich City. On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.\\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season; however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022: Final season and departure ====\\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans. His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \\\"respect for his big career\\\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\\u20131 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \\u20ac200 million per year; this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \\u20ac90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \\u20ac200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of \\u20ac100 million. According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023: Debut season and league runner-up ====\\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022. On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\\u20134 loss. He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2\\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\\u20130 away league victory against Damac, in the process, he became the first player in the history of Saudi Pro League to score a hat-trick in the first half of a match. Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice. Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\\u201323 season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u2013present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner ====\\nRonaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Man\\u00e9, N'Golo Kant\\u00e9, R\\u00faben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.\\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\\u201324 season in a 4\\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July. In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group. In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final. In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.\\n\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun, and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later. On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab. Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September. On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\\u20131 win. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4\\u20131 win over Al-Riyadh. On 30 December, Ronaldo closed the 4\\u20131 win over Al Taawon. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023).\\nIn the first knockout round of the AFC Champions League, Ronaldo faced fellow Saudi Arabian club Al-Fayha. After scoring the winner in a 1\\u20130 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20130 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3\\u20132 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1\\u20130 win over rivals Al-Ahli. On 8 April, in the semi-finals of Saudi Super Cup against city rivals Al-Hilal, he was sent off in the 86th minute, with his side being two goals down for \\\"violent conduct\\\", after being first cautioned for vehement protests against the match official, this marked his first red card while playing in Saudi Arabia. On 4 May, he clinched his 66th career hat-trick in a 6\\u20130 victory over Al Wehda, notching his 890th goal overall.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001\\u20132007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\n\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.\\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\\u00eds Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.\\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.\\nRonaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\n\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \\\"11 for Health\\\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.\\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \\u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128). He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020\\u201321 and 2021\\u201322 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd M\\u00fcller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award.

Lewandowski finished the season with 48 goals in 40 matches in all competitions, reaching at least the 40-goal landmark for the sixth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: Final season with Bayern and second European Golden Shoe ====\\nLewandowski kicked off his 2021\\u201322 Bundesliga season with a volley-shot equaliser in a 1\\u20131 opening fixture draw against Borussia M\\u00f6nchengladbach on 13 August, making him the first player to score in seven consecutive Bundesliga opening games. He also scored a brace and backheeled to Thomas M\\u00fcller in a 3\\u20131 away win against Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup on 17 August. The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Gerd M\\u00fcller, who died two days earlier. On 28 August, he scored his 15th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win over Hertha Berlin, setting a new club and German record for the most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 16, surpassing the previous record of 15 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller from 1969 to 1970. In addition, he managed to reach more than 300 goals with Bayern Munich in all competitions. On 18 September, Lewandowski scored in his 13th consecutive Bundesliga home match against VfL Bochum, surpassing the previous league record of 12 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller (October 1969 to April 1970) and Jupp Heynckes (June 1972 to February 1973). He ended the streak for most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 19, the new all-time German record.\\n\\nOn 21 November, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick against Benfica in a Champions League group stage match, becoming the fastest player to 80 UCL goals, in 100 appearances, edging past the previous record of Lionel Messi. On 23 November, he opened the score with a bicycle kick in a 2\\u20131 away win against Dynamo Kiev in a Champions League group stage match, thereby becoming the first player to score in nine consecutive games in two separate seasons of the competition. Midway through the season, Lewandowski finished second in the 2021 Ballon d'Or award, behind Lionel Messi of Paris Saint-Germain and received the Striker of the Year award by the France Football magazine. On 17 December, Lewandowski set the Bundesliga record for most goals in a calendar year with his 43rd goal. He became the second player, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to be the top goalscorer for club and country as a player playing in Europe for three consecutive years.\\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4\\u20130 away win over K\\u00f6ln. On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7\\u20131 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi's previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd M\\u00fcller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals. In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.\\nOn 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying \\\"My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== Transfer ====\\nAt Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer. Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of \\u20ac45 million, potentially rising to \\u20ac50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at \\u20ac500 million. Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time. Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022\\u201323: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy ====\\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6\\u20130 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou. On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0\\u20130 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league. On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4\\u20131 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August, followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4\\u20130 victory on 28 August. On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 victory over Viktoria Plze\\u0148, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs. On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his fifth league match for Barcelona, in their 4\\u20130 win over C\\u00e1diz, setting the record for most goals in the first five La Liga games of the season in the 21st century, and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October. \\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3\\u20133 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou. Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season. On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David Garc\\u00eda, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2\\u20131 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1\\u20131 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Girona and Getafe.\\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3\\u20131 in El Cl\\u00e1sico, winning his first title with the club. On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4\\u20132, confirming them as La Liga champions. He was the first Barcelona player to score more than 30 goals across all competitions in his debut season since Ronaldo Naz\\u00e1rio in 1996\\u201397. By the end of the 2022\\u201323 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches, becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons. Lewandowski also tied Lionel Messi for most top scorer awards in top 5 European leagues with eight.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u201324 season ====\\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5\\u20130 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023\\u201324 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He also became the oldest player, at 35 years and 29 days, to score for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, surpassing Gerard Piqu\\u00e9's previous record. On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century, with 35 goals, surpassing the record previously held by Samuel Eto'o.\\nOn 17 February 2024, Lewandowski secured a win for Barcelona in a 2\\u20131 victory over Celta Vigo by converting a retaken 97th-minute penalty. He became the most successful footballer in terms of the number of goals scored (407) over the past decade in the top five major European football leagues.\\nOn 22 February, he scored his 93rd Champions League goal in a 1\\u20131 draw against Napoli. Then on 12 March, Lewandowski scored the final goal in a 3\\u20131 win in the home leg, knocking out Napoli with a 4\\u20132 aggregate score. On 17 March, he was a key player in Barcelona's 3\\u20130 win over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid having been involved in all three goals. He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.

The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club.

On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.

His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches.

Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.

At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence.

In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.

In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128).

Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd M\\u00fcller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. In 2015, while playing for Bayern, he scored five goals in less than nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history as well as any major European football league for which he was awarded four Guinness World Records. Moreover, he has won the Bundesliga Top Scorer Award in a joint-record seven seasons, alongside Gerd M\\u00fcller, five of which were won consecutively, another record. He most prominently won it in the 2020\\u201321 Bundesliga where he scored 41 goals in a single campaign, breaking Gerd M\\u00fcller's previous Bundesliga record of 40 goals, set in 1971\\u201372. He also holds the record for most consecutive UEFA Champions League match wins, with 22. On 30 November 2021, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or, 33 points behind the winner Lionel Messi.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\n\\nLewandowski was born in Warsaw and grew up in Leszno, Warsaw West County.

The striker responded by finding the net two times in Dortmund's 3\\u20130 DFB-Pokal first round victory over Sandhausen. Lewandowski opened his league account in a 2\\u20130 win over N\\u00fcrnberg on 20 August 2011 by providing the finishing touch from a Mario G\\u00f6tze cross. On 1 October, Lewandowski netted a hat-trick and provided an assist in the club's 4\\u20130 victory over Augsburg, following a disappointing 0\\u20133 loss to Marseille in the UEFA Champions League group stage. He later scored his first Champions League goal in a 1\\u20133 away defeat to Olympiacos on 19 October. Dortmund climbed into second place in the Bundesliga with a comfortable 5\\u20130 victory over K\\u00f6ln on 22 October, with Lewandowski finding the net either side of half-time. Dortmund travelled to Freiburg on 17 December and Lewandowski struck twice and provided an assist for Kevin Gro\\u00dfkreutz, as Dortmund eased to a 4\\u20131 triumph, scoring his first hat-trick in Bundesliga. Due to his strong performances, he was named Footballer of the Year in Poland.\\nFollowing the winter break, on 22 January 2012, Dortmund thrashed Hamburg 5\\u20131 to move level on points with leaders Bayern Munich; Lewandowski netted twice and added an assist for Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski in the rout.

He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.

Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gawe\\u0142, a three-year-old boy from Hel; and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.\\nIn March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the \\\"Voice of the Children\\\" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.\\nIn 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.\\nIn March 2020, Lewandowski and his wife, Anna, donated \\u20ac1 million during the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nIn January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy. Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.\\nIn February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match. The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.\\nBeside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder. He also owns Stor9_, an agency specialising in marketing communications. In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$ 140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the \\\"List of 100 Richest Poles\\\" compiled by the Wprost magazine.\\n\\n\\n=== Sponsorship and media appearances ===\\nSince 2011 until 2018, he had a sponsorship contract with Gillette and appeared in numerous advertising campaigns of the brand.

He also collaborated and appeared in advertisements of Panasonic, T-Mobile Polska, Coca-Cola, Head & Shoulders and 4F.\\nIn 2016, a mobile game Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016 was released on Android and iOS platforms.\\nIn March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.\\nLewandowski featured on the cover of the Polish edition of EA Sports' FIFA 15 video game, alongside Lionel Messi. Lewandowski's \\\"X\\\" goal celebration\\u2014arms crossed and index fingers pointing up\\u2014has appeared in EA Sports' FIFA series since FIFA 18.\\nIn 2022, Lewandowski was the most popular Pole on social media.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.

The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club.

On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.

The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.

His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September.

Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.

In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence.

In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.

In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128).

Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd M\\u00fcller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. In 2015, while playing for Bayern, he scored five goals in less than nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history as well as any major European football league for which he was awarded four Guinness World Records. Moreover, he has won the Bundesliga Top Scorer Award in a joint-record seven seasons, alongside Gerd M\\u00fcller, five of which were won consecutively, another record. He most prominently won it in the 2020\\u201321 Bundesliga where he scored 41 goals in a single campaign, breaking Gerd M\\u00fcller's previous Bundesliga record of 40 goals, set in 1971\\u201372. He also holds the record for most consecutive UEFA Champions League match wins, with 22. On 30 November 2021, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or, 33 points behind the winner Lionel Messi.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\n\\nLewandowski was born in Warsaw and grew up in Leszno, Warsaw West County.

The striker responded by finding the net two times in Dortmund's 3\\u20130 DFB-Pokal first round victory over Sandhausen. Lewandowski opened his league account in a 2\\u20130 win over N\\u00fcrnberg on 20 August 2011 by providing the finishing touch from a Mario G\\u00f6tze cross. On 1 October, Lewandowski netted a hat-trick and provided an assist in the club's 4\\u20130 victory over Augsburg, following a disappointing 0\\u20133 loss to Marseille in the UEFA Champions League group stage. He later scored his first Champions League goal in a 1\\u20133 away defeat to Olympiacos on 19 October. Dortmund climbed into second place in the Bundesliga with a comfortable 5\\u20130 victory over K\\u00f6ln on 22 October, with Lewandowski finding the net either side of half-time. Dortmund travelled to Freiburg on 17 December and Lewandowski struck twice and provided an assist for Kevin Gro\\u00dfkreutz, as Dortmund eased to a 4\\u20131 triumph, scoring his first hat-trick in Bundesliga. Due to his strong performances, he was named Footballer of the Year in Poland.\\nFollowing the winter break, on 22 January 2012, Dortmund thrashed Hamburg 5\\u20131 to move level on points with leaders Bayern Munich; Lewandowski netted twice and added an assist for Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski in the rout.

He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.

Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gawe\\u0142, a three-year-old boy from Hel; and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.\\nIn March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the \\\"Voice of the Children\\\" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.\\nIn 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.\\nIn March 2020, Lewandowski and his wife, Anna, donated \\u20ac1 million during the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nIn January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy. Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.\\nIn February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match. The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.\\nBeside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder. He also owns Stor9_, an agency specialising in marketing communications. In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$ 140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the \\\"List of 100 Richest Poles\\\" compiled by the Wprost magazine.\\n\\n\\n=== Sponsorship and media appearances ===\\nSince 2011 until 2018, he had a sponsorship contract with Gillette and appeared in numerous advertising campaigns of the brand.

He also collaborated and appeared in advertisements of Panasonic, T-Mobile Polska, Coca-Cola, Head & Shoulders and 4F.\\nIn 2016, a mobile game Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016 was released on Android and iOS platforms.\\nIn March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.\\nLewandowski featured on the cover of the Polish edition of EA Sports' FIFA 15 video game, alongside Lionel Messi. Lewandowski's \\\"X\\\" goal celebration\\u2014arms crossed and index fingers pointing up\\u2014has appeared in EA Sports' FIFA series since FIFA 18.\\nIn 2022, Lewandowski was the most popular Pole on social media.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall. Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory. For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.\\nRonaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016\\u201317 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final. On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \\\"they made me who I am\\\". On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021. On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 away win against Atl\\u00e9tico, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2\\u20130 win over Club Am\\u00e9rica in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. He then scored a hat-trick in the 4\\u20132 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final. Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\\u20132 after extra-time. On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\\u00e9tico 3\\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u20132018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017\\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg. On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\\u00eamio in the final. On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi. On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\\u20133 win against Girona.\\n\\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \\\"PlayStation goal\\\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\\u20133 on aggregate. It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club. In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\\n\\n\\n=== Juventus ===\\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \\u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \\u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\\u00e9rez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018\\u20132020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \\\"violent conduct\\\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances. Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107's winner in a 1\\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\\u20130 away win over Fiorentina. After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate. Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.\\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 home win against Atl\\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April. In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan. Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored his first goal of the 2019\\u201320 season in a 4\\u20133 home league win over Napoli on 31 August 2019. On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3\\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive season, equalling Ra\\u00fal and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time, and equalled Ra\\u00fal's record of scoring against 33 different opponents. On 6 November in a 2\\u20131 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4\\u20130 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis S\\u00e1nchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3\\u20130 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games, and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2\\u20131 away defeat to Hellas Verona. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2\\u20131 away win against SPAL.\\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin D\\u017eeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.

Despite the win, the tie finished 2\\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.\\n\\n\\n==== 2020\\u20132021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure ====\\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria. On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\\u20131 away win. On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.

On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3\\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.\\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \\u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR. Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \\\"no intention\\\" of remaining a Juventus player. On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\\n\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Atalanta, and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November. On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.\\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals. On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 win over Norwich City. On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.\\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season; however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022: Final season and departure ====\\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans. His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \\\"respect for his big career\\\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\\u20131 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \\u20ac200 million per year; this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \\u20ac90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \\u20ac200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of \\u20ac100 million. According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023: Debut season and league runner-up ====\\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022. On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\\u20134 loss. He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2\\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\\u20130 away league victory against Damac, in the process, he became the first player in the history of Saudi Pro League to score a hat-trick in the first half of a match. Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice. Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\\u201323 season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u2013present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner ====\\nRonaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Man\\u00e9, N'Golo Kant\\u00e9, R\\u00faben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.\\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\\u201324 season in a 4\\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July. In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group. In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final. In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.\\n\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun, and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later. On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab. Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September. On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\\u20131 win. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4\\u20131 win over Al-Riyadh. On 30 December, Ronaldo closed the 4\\u20131 win over Al Taawon. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023).\\nIn the first knockout round of the AFC Champions League, Ronaldo faced fellow Saudi Arabian club Al-Fayha. After scoring the winner in a 1\\u20130 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20130 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3\\u20132 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1\\u20130 win over rivals Al-Ahli. On 8 April, in the semi-finals of Saudi Super Cup against city rivals Al-Hilal, he was sent off in the 86th minute, with his side being two goals down for \\\"violent conduct\\\", after being first cautioned for vehement protests against the match official, this marked his first red card while playing in Saudi Arabia. On 4 May, he clinched his 66th career hat-trick in a 6\\u20130 victory over Al Wehda, notching his 890th goal overall.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001\\u20132007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\n\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.\\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\\u00eds Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.\\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.\\nRonaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\n\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \\\"11 for Health\\\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.\\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \\u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128). He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020\\u201321 and 2021\\u201322 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd M\\u00fcller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award.

Lewandowski finished the season with 48 goals in 40 matches in all competitions, reaching at least the 40-goal landmark for the sixth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: Final season with Bayern and second European Golden Shoe ====\\nLewandowski kicked off his 2021\\u201322 Bundesliga season with a volley-shot equaliser in a 1\\u20131 opening fixture draw against Borussia M\\u00f6nchengladbach on 13 August, making him the first player to score in seven consecutive Bundesliga opening games. He also scored a brace and backheeled to Thomas M\\u00fcller in a 3\\u20131 away win against Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup on 17 August. The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Gerd M\\u00fcller, who died two days earlier. On 28 August, he scored his 15th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win over Hertha Berlin, setting a new club and German record for the most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 16, surpassing the previous record of 15 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller from 1969 to 1970. In addition, he managed to reach more than 300 goals with Bayern Munich in all competitions. On 18 September, Lewandowski scored in his 13th consecutive Bundesliga home match against VfL Bochum, surpassing the previous league record of 12 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller (October 1969 to April 1970) and Jupp Heynckes (June 1972 to February 1973). He ended the streak for most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 19, the new all-time German record.\\n\\nOn 21 November, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick against Benfica in a Champions League group stage match, becoming the fastest player to 80 UCL goals, in 100 appearances, edging past the previous record of Lionel Messi. On 23 November, he opened the score with a bicycle kick in a 2\\u20131 away win against Dynamo Kiev in a Champions League group stage match, thereby becoming the first player to score in nine consecutive games in two separate seasons of the competition. Midway through the season, Lewandowski finished second in the 2021 Ballon d'Or award, behind Lionel Messi of Paris Saint-Germain and received the Striker of the Year award by the France Football magazine. On 17 December, Lewandowski set the Bundesliga record for most goals in a calendar year with his 43rd goal. He became the second player, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to be the top goalscorer for club and country as a player playing in Europe for three consecutive years.\\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4\\u20130 away win over K\\u00f6ln. On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7\\u20131 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi's previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd M\\u00fcller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals. In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.\\nOn 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying \\\"My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== Transfer ====\\nAt Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer. Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of \\u20ac45 million, potentially rising to \\u20ac50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at \\u20ac500 million. Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time. Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022\\u201323: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy ====\\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6\\u20130 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou. On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0\\u20130 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league. On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4\\u20131 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August, followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4\\u20130 victory on 28 August. On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 victory over Viktoria Plze\\u0148, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs. On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his fifth league match for Barcelona, in their 4\\u20130 win over C\\u00e1diz, setting the record for most goals in the first five La Liga games of the season in the 21st century, and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October. \\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3\\u20133 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou. Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season. On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David Garc\\u00eda, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2\\u20131 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1\\u20131 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Girona and Getafe.\\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3\\u20131 in El Cl\\u00e1sico, winning his first title with the club. On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4\\u20132, confirming them as La Liga champions. He was the first Barcelona player to score more than 30 goals across all competitions in his debut season since Ronaldo Naz\\u00e1rio in 1996\\u201397. By the end of the 2022\\u201323 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches, becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons. Lewandowski also tied Lionel Messi for most top scorer awards in top 5 European leagues with eight.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u201324 season ====\\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5\\u20130 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023\\u201324 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He also became the oldest player, at 35 years and 29 days, to score for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, surpassing Gerard Piqu\\u00e9's previous record. On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century, with 35 goals, surpassing the record previously held by Samuel Eto'o.\\nOn 17 February 2024, Lewandowski secured a win for Barcelona in a 2\\u20131 victory over Celta Vigo by converting a retaken 97th-minute penalty. He became the most successful footballer in terms of the number of goals scored (407) over the past decade in the top five major European football leagues.\\nOn 22 February, he scored his 93rd Champions League goal in a 1\\u20131 draw against Napoli. Then on 12 March, Lewandowski scored the final goal in a 3\\u20131 win in the home leg, knocking out Napoli with a 4\\u20132 aggregate score. On 17 March, he was a key player in Barcelona's 3\\u20130 win over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid having been involved in all three goals. He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall. Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory. For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.\\nRonaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016\\u201317 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final. On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \\\"they made me who I am\\\". On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021. On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 away win against Atl\\u00e9tico, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2\\u20130 win over Club Am\\u00e9rica in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. He then scored a hat-trick in the 4\\u20132 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final. Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\\u20132 after extra-time. On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\\u00e9tico 3\\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u20132018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017\\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg. On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\\u00eamio in the final. On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi. On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\\u20133 win against Girona.\\n\\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \\\"PlayStation goal\\\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\\u20133 on aggregate. It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club. In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\\n\\n\\n=== Juventus ===\\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \\u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \\u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\\u00e9rez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018\\u20132020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \\\"violent conduct\\\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances. Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107's winner in a 1\\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\\u20130 away win over Fiorentina. After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate. Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.\\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 home win against Atl\\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April. In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan. Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored his first goal of the 2019\\u201320 season in a 4\\u20133 home league win over Napoli on 31 August 2019. On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3\\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive season, equalling Ra\\u00fal and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time, and equalled Ra\\u00fal's record of scoring against 33 different opponents. On 6 November in a 2\\u20131 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4\\u20130 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis S\\u00e1nchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3\\u20130 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games, and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2\\u20131 away defeat to Hellas Verona. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2\\u20131 away win against SPAL.\\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin D\\u017eeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.

Despite the win, the tie finished 2\\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.\\n\\n\\n==== 2020\\u20132021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure ====\\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria. On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\\u20131 away win. On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.

On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3\\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.\\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \\u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR. Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \\\"no intention\\\" of remaining a Juventus player. On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\\n\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Atalanta, and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November. On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.\\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals. On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 win over Norwich City. On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.\\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season; however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022: Final season and departure ====\\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans. His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \\\"respect for his big career\\\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\\u20131 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \\u20ac200 million per year; this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \\u20ac90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \\u20ac200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of \\u20ac100 million. According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023: Debut season and league runner-up ====\\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022. On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\\u20134 loss. He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2\\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\\u20130 away league victory against Damac, in the process, he became the first player in the history of Saudi Pro League to score a hat-trick in the first half of a match. Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice. Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\\u201323 season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u2013present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner ====\\nRonaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Man\\u00e9, N'Golo Kant\\u00e9, R\\u00faben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.\\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\\u201324 season in a 4\\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July. In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group. In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final. In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.\\n\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun, and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later. On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab. Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September. On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\\u20131 win. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4\\u20131 win over Al-Riyadh. On 30 December, Ronaldo closed the 4\\u20131 win over Al Taawon. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023).\\nIn the first knockout round of the AFC Champions League, Ronaldo faced fellow Saudi Arabian club Al-Fayha. After scoring the winner in a 1\\u20130 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20130 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3\\u20132 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1\\u20130 win over rivals Al-Ahli. On 8 April, in the semi-finals of Saudi Super Cup against city rivals Al-Hilal, he was sent off in the 86th minute, with his side being two goals down for \\\"violent conduct\\\", after being first cautioned for vehement protests against the match official, this marked his first red card while playing in Saudi Arabia. On 4 May, he clinched his 66th career hat-trick in a 6\\u20130 victory over Al Wehda, notching his 890th goal overall.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001\\u20132007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\n\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.\\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\\u00eds Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.\\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.\\nRonaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\n\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \\\"11 for Health\\\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.\\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \\u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128). He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020\\u201321 and 2021\\u201322 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd M\\u00fcller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award.

Lewandowski finished the season with 48 goals in 40 matches in all competitions, reaching at least the 40-goal landmark for the sixth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: Final season with Bayern and second European Golden Shoe ====\\nLewandowski kicked off his 2021\\u201322 Bundesliga season with a volley-shot equaliser in a 1\\u20131 opening fixture draw against Borussia M\\u00f6nchengladbach on 13 August, making him the first player to score in seven consecutive Bundesliga opening games. He also scored a brace and backheeled to Thomas M\\u00fcller in a 3\\u20131 away win against Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup on 17 August. The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Gerd M\\u00fcller, who died two days earlier. On 28 August, he scored his 15th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win over Hertha Berlin, setting a new club and German record for the most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 16, surpassing the previous record of 15 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller from 1969 to 1970. In addition, he managed to reach more than 300 goals with Bayern Munich in all competitions. On 18 September, Lewandowski scored in his 13th consecutive Bundesliga home match against VfL Bochum, surpassing the previous league record of 12 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller (October 1969 to April 1970) and Jupp Heynckes (June 1972 to February 1973). He ended the streak for most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 19, the new all-time German record.\\n\\nOn 21 November, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick against Benfica in a Champions League group stage match, becoming the fastest player to 80 UCL goals, in 100 appearances, edging past the previous record of Lionel Messi. On 23 November, he opened the score with a bicycle kick in a 2\\u20131 away win against Dynamo Kiev in a Champions League group stage match, thereby becoming the first player to score in nine consecutive games in two separate seasons of the competition. Midway through the season, Lewandowski finished second in the 2021 Ballon d'Or award, behind Lionel Messi of Paris Saint-Germain and received the Striker of the Year award by the France Football magazine. On 17 December, Lewandowski set the Bundesliga record for most goals in a calendar year with his 43rd goal. He became the second player, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to be the top goalscorer for club and country as a player playing in Europe for three consecutive years.\\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4\\u20130 away win over K\\u00f6ln. On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7\\u20131 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi's previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd M\\u00fcller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals. In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.\\nOn 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying \\\"My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== Transfer ====\\nAt Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer. Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of \\u20ac45 million, potentially rising to \\u20ac50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at \\u20ac500 million. Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time. Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022\\u201323: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy ====\\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6\\u20130 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou. On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0\\u20130 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league. On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4\\u20131 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August, followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4\\u20130 victory on 28 August. On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 victory over Viktoria Plze\\u0148, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs. On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his fifth league match for Barcelona, in their 4\\u20130 win over C\\u00e1diz, setting the record for most goals in the first five La Liga games of the season in the 21st century, and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October. \\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3\\u20133 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou. Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season. On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David Garc\\u00eda, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2\\u20131 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1\\u20131 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Girona and Getafe.\\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3\\u20131 in El Cl\\u00e1sico, winning his first title with the club. On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4\\u20132, confirming them as La Liga champions. He was the first Barcelona player to score more than 30 goals across all competitions in his debut season since Ronaldo Naz\\u00e1rio in 1996\\u201397. By the end of the 2022\\u201323 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches, becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons. Lewandowski also tied Lionel Messi for most top scorer awards in top 5 European leagues with eight.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u201324 season ====\\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5\\u20130 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023\\u201324 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He also became the oldest player, at 35 years and 29 days, to score for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, surpassing Gerard Piqu\\u00e9's previous record. On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century, with 35 goals, surpassing the record previously held by Samuel Eto'o.\\nOn 17 February 2024, Lewandowski secured a win for Barcelona in a 2\\u20131 victory over Celta Vigo by converting a retaken 97th-minute penalty. He became the most successful footballer in terms of the number of goals scored (407) over the past decade in the top five major European football leagues.\\nOn 22 February, he scored his 93rd Champions League goal in a 1\\u20131 draw against Napoli. Then on 12 March, Lewandowski scored the final goal in a 3\\u20131 win in the home leg, knocking out Napoli with a 4\\u20132 aggregate score. On 17 March, he was a key player in Barcelona's 3\\u20130 win over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid having been involved in all three goals. He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\\nMessi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006). As the squad's captain from 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and the 2016 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed this and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and victory in the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica. He led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\\"Leo\\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him. His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \\\"the best forward I've ever seen\\\".\\n\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \\\"Baby Dream Team\\\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\\u00e0bregas and Piqu\\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Barcelona ====\\nAt the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004, he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Messi won the league title in the 2004\\u201305, and 2005\\u201306 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured. On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Cl\\u00e1sico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3\\u20133 draw in injury time. In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006\\u201307, and 2007\\u201308 season without trophies, leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008\\u201309 season. During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.\\nDuring his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine for the first time on 2 May 2009 in a Cl\\u00e1sico. He scored twice and assisted once in a 6\\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium. He played his first final on 19 May, winning the Copa del Rey. Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple. In addition to the Copa del Rey, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the second half of 2009. Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history, For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. In the new year of the 2009\\u201310 season, Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996\\u201397 campaign. He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League, and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe. In the 2010\\u201311 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, Champions League, and a third consecutive La Liga title. Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year, and the league's top scorer and assist provider. He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.\\nDuring the 2011\\u201312 season, Messi scored 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions. He began the campaign winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies. At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time. For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns. On 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old with a hat-trick against Granada. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Guardiola resigned that season after a four-year cycle of success. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd M\\u00fcller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\n\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At\\u00f3mica (\\\"The Atomic Flea\\\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \\\"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\\\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\n\\nMessi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \\\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\\u00e9s Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\\u20134\\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\\u00e1rez.\\n\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\\n\\n=== Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona ===\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, \\\"I'm not even the best at Bar\\u00e7a\\\", in reference to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bar\\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \\\"New Maradona\\\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \\\"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\\\" C\\u00e9sar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \\\"at the level of the best Maradona\\\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisi\\u00f3n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \\\"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\\\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \\\"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\\\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo ===\\n\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \\u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) with a muscular build \\u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. From 2009\\u201310 to 2017\\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMessi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac40 million benchmark, with earnings of \\u20ac41 million in 2013, and the \\u20ac50\\u2013\\u20ac60 million points, with income of \\u20ac65 million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the \\u20ac100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of \\u20ac126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from \\u20ac7.8 million to \\u20ac13 million over the next five years. Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835 million (\\u20ac700 million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.\\n\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide. At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.\\n\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023. His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \\\"tourist attraction\\\".\\n\\nMadame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012. A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005\\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding. World Press Photo selected \\\"The Final Game\\\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary by filmmaker \\u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \\\"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\\\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India. During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family and relationships ===\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona\\u2013Espanyol derby.\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4\\u20130 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \\\"The Machine of '87\\\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\n\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \\\"Messi and Friends\\\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Raz\\u00f3n newspaper and was awarded \\u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\\u00e8res. Messi made a donation worth \\u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \\u00a3125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa Am\\u00e9rica in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech\\u2014whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi\\u2014in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamand\\u00fa Orsi remarking that \\\"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa Am\\u00e9rica, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tax fraud ===\\nMessi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \\u20ac4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \\u20ac5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \\u20ac1.7 million and \\u20ac1.4 million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \\\"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 22 November 2023\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nBarcelona\\n\\nLa Liga: 2004\\u201305, 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa del Rey: 2008\\u201309, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2020\\u201321\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\\nUEFA Champions League: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309, 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nLigue 1: 2021\\u201322, 2022\\u201323\\nTroph\\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\\nInter Miami\\n\\nLeagues Cup: 2023\\nArgentina U20\\n\\nFIFA World Youth Championship: 2005\\nArgentina U23\\n\\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\\nArgentina\\n\\nFIFA World Cup: 2022\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica: 2021\\nCONMEBOL\\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions: 2022\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2009\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019, 2022, 2023\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2009\\u201310, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022\\nFIFA World Cup Silver Boot: 2022\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2009, 2011\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Ball: 2005\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup Golden Boot: 2005\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2008\\u201309\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2010\\u201311, 2014\\u201315\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2014\\u201315, 2018\\u201319\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Best Player: 2015, 2021\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica Top Goalscorer: 2021\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2008\\u201309, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2014\\u201315, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318, 2018\\u201319\\nPichichi Trophy: 2009\\u221210, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u221213, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u221218, 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320, 2020\\u201321\\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2020, 2023\\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Sportsperson of the Year: 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023\\nArgentine Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nProfile at Inter Miami\\nProfile at PSG\\nProfile at FC Barcelona\\nProfile at La Liga\\nProfile at Ligue 1\\nProfile at MLS\\nLionel Messi at BDFutbol \\nLionel Messi at Soccerbase \\nLionel Messi at Soccerway \\nLionel Messi at National-Football-Teams.com \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 FIFA competition record (archived) \\nLionel Messi \\u2013 UEFA competition record (archive)\",\n          \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\\u027ei\\u0283\\u02c8tj\\u0250nu \\u0281\\u0254\\u02c8naldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \\u20ac94 million (\\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \\u20ac100 million (\\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S\\u00e3o Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos\\u00e9 Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Ant\\u00f3nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S\\u00e3o Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C\\u00e1tia \\\"Katia\\\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \\u00a31,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \\\"disrespected\\\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.\\n\\n\\n== Club career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sporting CP ===\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 B\\u00f6l\\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.\\nOn 14 August 2002, Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th minute in place of To\\u00f1ito.\\nAs far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2\\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores. On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\\u20130 win. Over the course of the 2002\\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Ars\\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\\u00e1dio Jos\\u00e9 Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \\u00a312.24 million for what he considered to be \\\"one of the most exciting young players\\\" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.\\n\\n\\n=== Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2003\\u20132007: Development and breakthrough ====\\n\\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \\\"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\\\"\\n\\n \\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \\\"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\\\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \\\"elaborate\\\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \\\"not a show pony, but the real thing\\\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\\u20134. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \\\"one-fingered gesture\\\" towards Benfica fans, and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\\u201307 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.\\n\\n\\n==== 2007\\u20132008: Collective and individual success ====\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006\\u201307 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7\\u20131 win over Roma. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3\\u20132 win, but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3\\u20130 at the San Siro. He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1\\u20130 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were raised to \\u00a3120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kak\\u00e1 for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kak\\u00e1 and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\\u20130 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\\u20131 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\\u20130 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious 1\\u20131, winning the penalties 6\\u20135. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \\\"modern slavery\\\". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year.\\n\\n\\n==== 2008\\u20132009: Ballon d'Or and continued success ====\\n\\nAhead of the 2008\\u201309 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5\\u20130 win against Stoke City on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2\\u20130 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n=== Real Madrid ===\\n\\nAhead of the 2009\\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \\u00a380 million (\\u20ac94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \\u20ac11 million per year and contained a \\u20ac1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Ra\\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\u00e9fano.\\n\\n\\n==== 2009\\u20132013: World record transfer and La Liga title ====\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\\u20132 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\\u00fcrich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\\u00eda. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.\\nFollowing Ra\\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\\u201311 season. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\\u00e1laga. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. During a historic series of four Cl\\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.\\nRonaldo began the 2012\\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \\\"professional issue\\\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\\u20131 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\\u20132 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\\n\\n\\n==== 2013\\u20132015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La D\\u00e9cima ====\\nFollowing the 2012\\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe. He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\\u20132 win against M\\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored, a club record. In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 draw at home, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford. He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\\u20130 win in the second leg.\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of \\u20ac17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of \\u20ac100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \\\"BBC\\\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4\\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\\u20131 final win over Atl\\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \\\"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\\\". As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\\u00f3n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\\u20131 to claim the trophy. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\\u00e1rez. Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\\u00e9bio, who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\\u00fatbol Profesional, which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds. His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\\u20130 win against Schalke 04. He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\\u20132 on aggregate. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\\u20131 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano. Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\\u00e9fano's club record of 28. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015\\u20132017: All-time Madrid top scorer ====\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\\u00fal. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malm\\u00f6 FF in a 2\\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\\u00f6.\\n\\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi. He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals. The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall. Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory. For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.\\nRonaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016\\u201317 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final. On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \\\"they made me who I am\\\". On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021. On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 away win against Atl\\u00e9tico, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2\\u20130 win over Club Am\\u00e9rica in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. He then scored a hat-trick in the 4\\u20132 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final. Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2016\\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\\u20132 after extra-time. On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\\u00e9tico 3\\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\\n\\n\\n==== 2017\\u20132018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win ====\\nAt the start of the 2017\\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg. On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\\u00eamio in the final. On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi. On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\\u20133 win against Girona.\\n\\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \\\"PlayStation goal\\\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\\u20133 on aggregate. It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club. In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\\n\\n\\n=== Juventus ===\\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \\u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \\u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\\u00e9rez.\\n\\n\\n==== 2018\\u20132020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona. On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \\\"violent conduct\\\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances. Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107's winner in a 1\\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\\u20130 away win over Fiorentina. After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate. Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.\\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\\u20130 home win against Atl\\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April. In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan. Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.\\n\\nRonaldo scored his first goal of the 2019\\u201320 season in a 4\\u20133 home league win over Napoli on 31 August 2019. On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3\\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive season, equalling Ra\\u00fal and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time, and equalled Ra\\u00fal's record of scoring against 33 different opponents. On 6 November in a 2\\u20131 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2\\u20131 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4\\u20130 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis S\\u00e1nchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3\\u20130 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games, and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2\\u20131 away defeat to Hellas Verona. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2\\u20131 away win against SPAL.\\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin D\\u017eeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.

Despite the win, the tie finished 2\\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.\\n\\n\\n==== 2020\\u20132021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure ====\\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\\u20130 home win over Sampdoria. On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\\u20131 away win. On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.

On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3\\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.\\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \\u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR. Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \\\"no intention\\\" of remaining a Juventus player. On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer. On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles ====\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial \\u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\\n\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Atalanta, and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November. On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.\\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal, before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022. Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals. On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\\u20132 win over Norwich City. On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.\\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season; however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022: Final season and departure ====\\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans. His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer. However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.\\n\\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September. On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \\\"respect for his big career\\\". On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\\u20131 win against Everton. Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle; Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team. Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage. Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \\\"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\\\". Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.\\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \\\"betrayed\\\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \\\"because he doesn't show respect for me\\\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \\\"sporting director and not even a coach\\\". On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \\\"no evolution\\\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \\\"technology, infrastructure\\\". Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \\\"did not care about the club\\\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \\\"marketing club\\\". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.\\n\\n\\n=== Al Nassr ===\\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \\u20ac200 million per year; this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \\u20ac90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \\u20ac200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of \\u20ac100 million. According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023: Debut season and league runner-up ====\\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022. On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\\u20134 loss. He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2\\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\\u20130 away league victory against Damac, in the process, he became the first player in the history of Saudi Pro League to score a hat-trick in the first half of a match. Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice. Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\\u201323 season.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u2013present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner ====\\nRonaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Man\\u00e9, N'Golo Kant\\u00e9, R\\u00faben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.\\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\\u201324 season in a 4\\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July. In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group. In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final. In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.\\n\\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun, and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later. On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab. Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September. On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\\u20131 win. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4\\u20131 win over Al-Riyadh. On 30 December, Ronaldo closed the 4\\u20131 win over Al Taawon. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023).\\nIn the first knockout round of the AFC Champions League, Ronaldo faced fellow Saudi Arabian club Al-Fayha. After scoring the winner in a 1\\u20130 win away in his 1000th club appearance, he scored the winning goal in a 2\\u20130 win at home, helping Al-Nassr reach the quarter-finals of the competition. On 25 February 2024, Ronaldo was filmed making an alleged obscene gesture towards rival fans who were jeering him after a 3\\u20132 victory over Al-Shabab. This act resulted in Ronaldo being suspended four days later for one match by the Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. Four days later, Ronaldo scored his 50th goal for Al-Nassr, netting a penalty in a narrow 1\\u20130 win over rivals Al-Ahli. On 8 April, in the semi-finals of Saudi Super Cup against city rivals Al-Hilal, he was sent off in the 86th minute, with his side being two goals down for \\\"violent conduct\\\", after being first cautioned for vehement protests against the match official, this marked his first red card while playing in Saudi Arabia. On 4 May, he clinched his 66th career hat-trick in a 6\\u20130 victory over Al Wehda, notching his 890th goal overall.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2001\\u20132007: Youth level and senior debut ===\\n\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.\\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\\u00eds Figo. He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal. After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals, he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Netherlands. He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.\\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1\\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\\u20130 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132012: Assuming captaincy ===\\n\\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.\\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \\\"group of death\\\". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\\u20131 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\\u20130 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot. Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \\\"demanded\\\" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012\\u20132016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion ===\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: \\\"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\\\" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\\u20130 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2\\u20132 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\\u20131 win over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games.\\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\\u0161i\\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\\u20130 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2\\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\\u20130 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016\\u20132018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup ===\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.\\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\\u20132 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1\\u20130 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\\u20131 after extra time.\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\\u20130 win.\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018\\u20132020: Nations League title and 100 international goals ===\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\\u20130.\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021\\u2013present: All-time international appearances and top goalscorer ===\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest. This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. He also became the first player to score at five Euros, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2\\u20131 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3\\u20130 friendly win over Qatar at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Est\\u00e1dio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\\n\\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000. He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.\\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5\\u20130 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\\n\\n\\n== Player profile ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style of play ===\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\\n\\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \\\"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\\\"\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \\\"false\\\", \\\"attacking\\\", or \\\"goalscoring winger\\\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\\u20132\\u20133\\u20131 or 4\\u20133\\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\\u017euki\\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\\u017euki\\u0107 in a 4\\u20133\\u20131\\u20132, 4\\u20134\\u20132, or 3\\u20135\\u20132 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\\n\\n\\n=== Image ===\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \\\"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\\\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \\\"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\\\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \\\"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\\\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \\\"his relative immobility\\\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \\\"arrogant image\\\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \\\"victim\\\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\\n\\n\\n=== Goal celebrations ===\\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \\\"storming jump\\\" and \\\"turn\\\", before \\\"landing in spread-eagled fashion\\\" into his \\\"signature power stance\\\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \\\"S\\u00ed\\\" (Spanish and Italian for \\\"yes\\\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \\\"Siu\\\" in the media.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\\n\\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \\\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\\\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \\\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\\\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\\\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\\\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\\\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \\\"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\\\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \\\"commander\\\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \\\"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\\\"\\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \\\"gone\\\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \\\"sharing the stage\\\". After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\nSince his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \\\"Sii\\\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\\nWith earnings of \\u20ac720 million (\\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\\u201315. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\\u201316. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\\u201317. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.\\nRonaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.\\n\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \\\"Legacy\\\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\\u00e3o da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Bel\\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \\\"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\\\" A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\\nOn 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nSince 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manh\\u00e3, Record and Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Express\\u00e3o Livre.\\nIn 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \\\"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy ===\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated \\u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\\u00edtimo and Nacional.\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \\\"11 for Health\\\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.\\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \\u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \\u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.\\nRonaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\\u00edguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.\\nRonaldo's father, Jos\\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.\\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \\\"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\\\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \\\"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\\\".\\nRonaldo is of (one eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.\\nAfter her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \\u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \\u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \\u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \\\"intentional defamation campaign\\\" with parts significantly \\\"altered and/or completely fabricated\\\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \\\"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \\u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \\\"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\\\" the case, despite the documents containing \\\"privileged communications\\\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \\\"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\\\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \\\"cyber-hacked attorney\\u2013client privileged documents\\\" were actions representing \\\"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Club ===\\nAs of match played 17 May 2024\\n\\n\\n=== International ===\\n\\nAs of match played 26 March 2024\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\n\\nSporting CP\\n\\nSuperta\\u00e7a C\\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2002\\nManchester United\\n\\nPremier League: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Cup: 2003\\u201304\\nFootball League Cup: 2005\\u201306, 2008\\u201309\\nFA Community Shield: 2007\\nUEFA Champions League: 2007\\u201308\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\\nReal Madrid\\n\\nLa Liga: 2011\\u201312, 2016\\u201317\\nCopa del Rey: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314\\nSupercopa de Espa\\u00f1a: 2012, 2017\\nUEFA Champions League: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\\nJuventus\\n\\nSerie A: 2018\\u201319, 2019\\u201320\\nCoppa Italia: 2020\\u201321\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\\nAl Nassr\\n\\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\\nPortugal\\n\\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\\nUEFA Nations League: 2018\\u201319\\nIndividual\\n\\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007\\u201308\\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317\\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007\\u201308, 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nGolden Foot: 2020\\nFIFA Pusk\\u00e1s Award: 2009\\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007\\u201308, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315, 2015\\u201316, 2016\\u201317, 2017\\u201318\\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006\\u201307, 2007\\u201308\\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013\\u201314\\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007\\u201308\\nPichichi Trophy: 2010\\u201311, 2013\\u201314, 2014\\u201315\\nCapocannoniere: 2020\\u201321\\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022\\nOrders\\n\\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\\u00e7osa (Portuguese Royal Family)\\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\\n Commander of the Order of Merit\\nCord\\u00e3o Auton\\u00f3mico de Distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\\nList of men's footballers with 500 or more goals\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as the most successful player in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszk\\u00f3w, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Pozna\\u0144, helping the team win the 2009\\u201310 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. Prior to the start of the 2014\\u201315 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019\\u201320 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019\\u201321), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season. He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.\\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 148 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the fourth overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Romelu Lukaku (83), Ferenc Pusk\\u00e1s (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (128). He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020\\u201321 and 2021\\u201322 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd M\\u00fcller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award.

Lewandowski finished the season with 48 goals in 40 matches in all competitions, reaching at least the 40-goal landmark for the sixth time.\\n\\n\\n==== 2021\\u20132022: Final season with Bayern and second European Golden Shoe ====\\nLewandowski kicked off his 2021\\u201322 Bundesliga season with a volley-shot equaliser in a 1\\u20131 opening fixture draw against Borussia M\\u00f6nchengladbach on 13 August, making him the first player to score in seven consecutive Bundesliga opening games. He also scored a brace and backheeled to Thomas M\\u00fcller in a 3\\u20131 away win against Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup on 17 August. The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Gerd M\\u00fcller, who died two days earlier. On 28 August, he scored his 15th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5\\u20130 win over Hertha Berlin, setting a new club and German record for the most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 16, surpassing the previous record of 15 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller from 1969 to 1970. In addition, he managed to reach more than 300 goals with Bayern Munich in all competitions. On 18 September, Lewandowski scored in his 13th consecutive Bundesliga home match against VfL Bochum, surpassing the previous league record of 12 held by Gerd M\\u00fcller (October 1969 to April 1970) and Jupp Heynckes (June 1972 to February 1973). He ended the streak for most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 19, the new all-time German record.\\n\\nOn 21 November, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick against Benfica in a Champions League group stage match, becoming the fastest player to 80 UCL goals, in 100 appearances, edging past the previous record of Lionel Messi. On 23 November, he opened the score with a bicycle kick in a 2\\u20131 away win against Dynamo Kiev in a Champions League group stage match, thereby becoming the first player to score in nine consecutive games in two separate seasons of the competition. Midway through the season, Lewandowski finished second in the 2021 Ballon d'Or award, behind Lionel Messi of Paris Saint-Germain and received the Striker of the Year award by the France Football magazine. On 17 December, Lewandowski set the Bundesliga record for most goals in a calendar year with his 43rd goal. He became the second player, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to be the top goalscorer for club and country as a player playing in Europe for three consecutive years.\\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4\\u20130 away win over K\\u00f6ln. On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7\\u20131 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season. With the hat-trick, he also became the fastest player to 85 UCL goals, again edging past Lionel Messi's previous record. He also joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi as the only three players to have ten or more goals in three or more UCL campaigns, and joined Messi as the only two players who have scored a first half hat trick in a UCL knockout game. However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd M\\u00fcller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals. In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.\\nOn 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying \\\"My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Barcelona ===\\n\\n\\n==== Transfer ====\\nAt Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer. Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of \\u20ac45 million, potentially rising to \\u20ac50 million with add-ons. The contract included a release clause set at \\u20ac500 million. Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time. Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022\\u201323: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy ====\\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6\\u20130 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou. On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0\\u20130 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league. On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4\\u20131 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August, followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4\\u20130 victory on 28 August. On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\\u20131 victory over Viktoria Plze\\u0148, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs. On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his fifth league match for Barcelona, in their 4\\u20130 win over C\\u00e1diz, setting the record for most goals in the first five La Liga games of the season in the 21st century, and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October. \\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3\\u20133 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou. Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season. On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David Garc\\u00eda, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2\\u20131 against Osasuna. However, Lewandowski participated in the 1\\u20131 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Girona and Getafe.\\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\\u00f1a final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3\\u20131 in El Cl\\u00e1sico, winning his first title with the club. On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4\\u20132, confirming them as La Liga champions. He was the first Barcelona player to score more than 30 goals across all competitions in his debut season since Ronaldo Naz\\u00e1rio in 1996\\u201397. By the end of the 2022\\u201323 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches, becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons. Lewandowski also tied Lionel Messi for most top scorer awards in top 5 European leagues with eight.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023\\u201324 season ====\\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5\\u20130 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023\\u201324 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He also became the oldest player, at 35 years and 29 days, to score for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, surpassing Gerard Piqu\\u00e9's previous record. On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\\u20132 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century, with 35 goals, surpassing the record previously held by Samuel Eto'o.\\nOn 17 February 2024, Lewandowski secured a win for Barcelona in a 2\\u20131 victory over Celta Vigo by converting a retaken 97th-minute penalty. He became the most successful footballer in terms of the number of goals scored (407) over the past decade in the top five major European football leagues.\\nOn 22 February, he scored his 93rd Champions League goal in a 1\\u20131 draw against Napoli. Then on 12 March, Lewandowski scored the final goal in a 3\\u20131 win in the home leg, knocking out Napoli with a 4\\u20132 aggregate score. On 17 March, he was a key player in Barcelona's 3\\u20130 win over Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid having been involved in all three goals. He scored one goal and produced two assists helping his side move to the second spot in the La Liga table. On 29 April, he scored his first La Liga hat-trick to help his team get a 4\\u20132 win against Valencia.\\n\\n\\n== International career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007\\u20132013: Youth level and early international career ===\\n\\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007. He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.\\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Only W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\\u20130 victory.\\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match. He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013\\u20132017: Assuming the captaincy ===\\n\\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5\\u20130 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain. Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1\\u20131 home draw. Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7\\u20130 win. On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4\\u20130 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes. On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2\\u20132 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts. Three days later he headed the winner in a 2\\u20131 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France. Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Following the 1\\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time. In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost. At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017\\u2013present: All-time Poland top scorer ===\\n\\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\\u0142odzimierz Luba\\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland. On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland. He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.\\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.\\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.\\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty; however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination. He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.\\n\\n\\n== Style of play ==\\n\\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski. A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet. Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions. Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness. \\nLewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.\\n\\n\\n== Outside football ==\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.\\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).\\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7\\u20131 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.\\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. \\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.\\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.
