# Soccar_Player_Goal_Kick_Text_Summarization_Project
This Text Summarization Project aims to develop an automated system that generates concise summaries of goal kick events in soccer matches
In this project, we harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text summarization techniques to explore the vast and exciting world of the FIFA World Cup. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the tournament's rich history, notable matches, iconic players, and significant moments.
