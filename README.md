# **Introduction**

This Text Summarization Project aims to develop an automated system that generates concise summaries of goal kick events in soccer matches
In this project, we harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text summarization techniques to explore the vast and exciting world of the FIFA World Cup. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the tournament's rich history, notable matches, iconic players, and significant moments.

# **Skills**

**1)** **Python Programming:**

Proficiency in Python is fundamental as it is the primary language used for NLP tasks.

**2)** **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

* Text Preprocessing: Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying key entities (e.g., players, teams, locations).
* Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Understanding the grammatical structure of the text.
* Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of text to understand public and media opinions.
  
**3)** **Text Summarization Techniques:**

* Extractive Summarization: Selecting key sentences from the text to create a summary.
* Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences that capture the main ideas of the text, often using deep learning models.
  
**4)** **Machine Learning:**

* Understanding of basic machine learning concepts and algorithms.
* Knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques relevant to NLP.
  
**5)** **Deep Learning:**
* Familiarity with neural networks and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* Experience with transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for advanced NLP tasks.
  
**6)** **Data Collection and Management:**
* Web Scraping: Techniques to gather data from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.
* APIs: Utilizing APIs to collect data from platforms such as Wikipedia, sports databases, and other relevant sources.
  
**7)** **Data Analysis and Visualization:**

* Using libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
* Employing Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for creating visualizations to illustrate trends and insights.
  
**8)** **Libraries and Tools:**
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text processing and linguistic data analysis.
* spaCy: An open-source software library for advanced NLP.
* Gensim: For topic modeling and document similarity analysis.
* Sumy: A library specifically for text summarization tasks.

**9)** **Project Management and Collaboration:**
* Version control using Git and GitHub for collaborative work and tracking changes.
* Writing clear documentation and reports to explain methodologies and findings.
  
**10)** **Evaluation Metrics**:
* Knowledge of metrics to evaluate the performance of summarization models, such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).

 # **Recommendations**
üìà Continued monitoring and updating of the model with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.

# **How to Use**
üîß Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.
